# HW1-Semanric-HTML-madness
HW-correct HTML tag usage

This project was to refactor the code provided

Overall, the task was easy because there was not much editing and changing of the actual layout. 

-I fixed the broken link at the nav bar
-gave names to all photos in the page
-gave the website a title
-updated tags (section, header, main, aside & footer)
-updated the style.css to reflect the changes I made to the tags in the HTML 

then cleaned up the code to make it easier to read in the future
